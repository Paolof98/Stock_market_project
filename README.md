# Analysing and forecasting stock market returns: project for the Data Analystics bootcamp at the Curious Lounge Academy

* Part 1: Analysing the stock market: regression models
* Part 2: Forecasting stock market returns with ARIMA models
* Part 3: Beyond ARIMA models: looking into Machine Learning models

To do this project I analysed economic data from the US, from the end of the 1990s to the end of 2024. 

The independent variables I used were:

* Real GDP, real GDP gorwth rate
